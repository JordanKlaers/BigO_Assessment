# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation!

 ##

  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:

 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.

    > Answer here
    Identify the computational time of a function.

---


 2. What 2 things does it measure?

    > Answer here
    time and size

---


 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?

    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    > Answer here
B.
---



4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?

   Binary Search

   Bubble Sort

   Quick Sort (average case)

   Linear Search

   > Answer here
binary search
---



5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)

    O(n log n)

    O(n)

    O(n^2)

    > Answer here
    O(log N)
---


 6. Describe what sets these these 3 complexities apart from each other: O(1), O(n) and O(n^2)

    > Answer here
    o(1) is constant time, o(n) is linear an o(n^2) is quadratic time
---


7. How would you recognize O(log n) and O(n log n) time complexities in a function?

    > Answer here
      log n searches through organized data and O(n log n ) organizes the data before iterating
