# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation!

 ##

  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:

 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.


  answer -  Identify the computational time of a function.




 2. What 2 things does it measure?


  answer -  time and size




 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?

    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)


  answer -  B.




4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?

   Binary Search

   Bubble Sort

   Quick Sort (average case)

   Linear Search


answer -  binary search




5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)

    O(n log n)

    O(n)

    O(n^2)


answer -    O(log N)



 6. Describe what sets these these 3 complexities apart from each other: O(1), O(n) and O(n^2)


answer -    o(1) is constant time - an example would be grabbing the value from an array using its index
o(n) is linear - an example would be looping over an array to get the sum of all its values
 o(n^2) is quadratic time - an example would be looping over an array, while comparying each array value, to every other value in the array
 which would be a for loop nested inside of a for loop.

 These three complexities differ because of the time it takes to run the function. A function at O(1) will always take the same amount of time to run in its average and worst case scenario. A function at O(n) could vary in the length of time to run, but N would be the worst case time. The worst case scenario of A function at O(n^2) is equal to the worst case of O(n) * the worst case of O(n)



7. How would you recognize O(log n) and O(n log n) time complexities in a function?


  answer -    log n searches through organized data and O(n log n ) organizes the data before iterating
